Several old demonstrations of simple javascript to manipulate web pages

- Browser-based HTML Editor ( http://layoutgenerator.blogspot.com/ )
This is a primitive real-time HTML and CSS editor i built back in 2017. Move your cursor to the right edge to open the editing field. The one with the blue bar modifies the overall <body>, while the one with the the red bar modifies the CSS.

- CSS Generator ( http://cssgen.blogspot.com/ )
This is a primitive CSS editor that helps you write CSS styles with minimum manual typing. I wrote the code back in 2017, thinking that it might easen CSS building in touchscreen devices. Pick your element at the drop-down menu on the left, and define it's attributes below. Click on Input at the top-right edge of page to insert that element into the text field. You can then copy the whole text-field when you're done defining the CSS.

HTML Preview Tool ( http://shtmlgen.blogspot.com/ )
This is a simple HTML and CSS editor i wrote in 2017 -- meant for people who wanted to experiment with how a div element changes by modifying it's CSS attributes. Pick an element from d1 to d15 ( select it from the CSS Modifiers section ), then play with the sliders a bit. You'll see that the element changes accordingly and immediately.
